Custom function for generating a cross-platform compatible fmpurl for opening files and running scripts via the Open URL script step.

This file mostly exists due to [this bug](http://thefmkb.com/11358) and my wanting to do cross-platform testing to confirm I can open/close files and run scripts via fmpurl.
